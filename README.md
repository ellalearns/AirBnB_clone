# AirBNB Clone - ALXSE

This project clones the Airbnb website. 

Right now, the first step is building the console and integrating json serialization for persistence.

## About the console
The console is a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.They include the following:
- create a base model for instantiating new objects with attributes like name and number, plus methods like to_dict() and save()
- re-create an object instance from dict 
- store a dictionary object as a json string in a file
- retrieve an object
- write a console.py program as the entry point of the command interpreter
- add the necessary commands to console.py
- create other classes like User from the BaseModel
- manage serialization and deserialization of all our new classes
- and so on and so forth!
